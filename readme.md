# DataCamp — Associate AI Engineer for Developers (Tutorials)

Welcome! 👋  
This repo contains my hands-on tutorials, notes, and mini-projects based on the **DataCamp “Associate AI Engineer for Developers”** track. The goal is simple: learn the concepts by building small, practical examples you can reuse in real apps.

## What you’ll find here

- **Step-by-step tutorials** that mirror the course flow
- **Clean, runnable code** with minimal magic
- **Small exercises** and “try this next” extensions
- **Reference notes** (APIs, patterns, pitfalls, and best practices)

## Repo structure

> This structure may evolve as I progress through the course.
